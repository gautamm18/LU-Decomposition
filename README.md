# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. import the numpy module to use the built-in function for calculation
2. prepare the lists frim each linear equations and assign in np.array()
3. using the np.linalg.slove(), we can find the solution
4. end the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
